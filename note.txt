We have issues.
Here is a list of the following issues:

1: When trying to convert a docx to pdf the buttons are disabled telling us that we have insuffient tokens even when we actually have enough (as anonymous user and when logged in)

2: Error when trying to register a new user. We get this message in the server console: Registration API error: TypeError: User.findOne is not a function
    at POST (src\app\api\auth\register\route.jsx:22:36)
  20 |
  21 |     // Check if user already exists
> 22 |     const existingUser = await User.findOne({ email });
     |                                    ^
  23 |     if (existingUser) {
  24 |       return NextResponse.json({ error: 'User with this email already exists.' }, { status: 409 });
  25 |     }
 POST /api/auth/register 500 in 565ms. It is suggesting the user already exists, but it doesn't

 I know there will be other issues as well but until i get past these problems i cannot test the site fully.
